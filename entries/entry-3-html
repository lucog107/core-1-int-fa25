    <h2>âœ¨ Powder</h2>
    <p>Powder is a often skipped step, but it is key to make you makeup last all day and not crease. When you donâ€™t set your liquid concealer with powder it can often crease. Creasing is when it separates and creates lines of product on your wrinkles. There are two types of powder; Loose and pressed. Loose powder is usually more effective but a bit harder to use. I like the Laura Mercier loose powder which is good for all skin tones. The Charlotte Tilbury powder is a good pressed option which will also provide you with some coverage. However, their shade range is not very good. </p>
