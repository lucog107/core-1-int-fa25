   <p>3 - Powder</p> 
</body>
<p>Powder is a often skipped step, but it is key to make you makeup last all day and not crease. When you don’t set your liquid concealer with powder it can often crease. Creasing is when it separates and creates lines of product on your wrinkles. There are two types of powder; Loose and pressed. Loose powder is usually more effective but a bit harder to use. I like the Laura Mercier loose powder which is good for all skin tones. The Charlotte Tilbury powder is a good pressed option which will also provide you with some coverage. However, their shade range is not very good. </p>
