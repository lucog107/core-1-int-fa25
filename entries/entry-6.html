    <h2>✨ Eyeshadow</h2>
    <p>It is very common to be scared of eyeshadow, but honestly, there is nothing to worry about! You just need to follow one simple rule to create a basic look that will look good on anyone: the darkest shade should always be closest to your eyelash and on the outside of your eye. Darkest always on the corner, then build up to a lighter shade. The more you try the more you learn. After your eyeshadow, you curl eyelashes then apply mascara. This makes a big difference. The reason the Makeup By Mario pallete is so good is because it provides every possible color you need to create a basic look to a complicated night out look. The colors are also good for everybody, no matter your skin tone.</p>
