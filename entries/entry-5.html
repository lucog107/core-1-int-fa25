    <h2>âœ¨ Blush</h2>
    <p>If you were to ask people around 5 years ago, nobody used blush, it simply was not on trend. However, now a days, it is one if not the one product that is most used. Blush adds life and color to the face, similar to bronzer. There are many types, shimmer, matte, and they also come in different formulas. I like to layer a powder one on top of a cream one. The Rhode blush is very beginner friendly and blends very easily. You can use a brush or a sponge to apply it. It should sit above your bronzer on your cheek. The Nars powder blush is beautiful because it also includes some shimmer. Applying it on top of the cream blush will give you a glow in your skin and will also help your blush last longer.</p>
