    <h2>✨ Eyebrows</h2>
    <p>Eyebrows are important to frame your face. However, I personally do not draw them in from scratch. Those who have less eyebrow hair or do not like their natural design can draw new ones in. I like to darken mine and set them in place. The product that does both and is very practical is the glossier boy brow. If you don‘t want any color, they also sell it in clear.</p>
